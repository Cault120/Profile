    <h3>Things I like</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrCreepen">Dr.Creepen</a> has a nice voice and reads some very interesting
            stories. Great for background noise for work or driving. Majority of the stories are more on the scary/gorey
            side, but
            there is usually humor sprinkled about. The details and descriptors are phenomenal. </li>
        <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a> is the hands down best place to find, download, and play
            some of
            the internets finest pc games. A requirement of any quality gaming pc.</li>

    <H3>A paragraph about me</H3>
    <p>I have ADHD. What this means to most people is that I can’t focus nor can I sit still for five seconds. Whereas
        that isn’t all that far off, the truth is that it's a complicated thing to describe. It is a disorder that acts
        more like a list of symptoms that don’t seem to make much sense. That is mostly because it affects everyone just
        a little differently. That means that I can find someone who has few if any shared symptoms or experiences. It
        also means that finding treatments or aid to help out is nigh impossible for some. How do you treat getting
        bored with something after five minutes, or the reverse, being obsessed with something for no reason? It's not
        like we can just push past and focus on the task at hand when every ten seconds there is a new thing in your
        vision or ear that sparks a rabbit hole of thought that you don't realize you are in until fifteen minutes
        later. The best is when people say that they have ADHD when they very clearly don’t and have no idea how much it
        messes with your brain. Most of it is little things that just seem stupid at the time. It's looking back on all
        of them to realize that this is how you live your days, second guessing where you put your keys after distinctly
        remembering them being right here on the counter no more than twenty minutes prior then finding them already in
        your pocket because you subconsciously picked them up to fiddle with them while finding your phone. Though I
        will say that some of the things we come up with at four in the morning while going down yet another Alice in
        Wonderland spiral of things we can't begin to describe make for some great conversations with friends. Anyways,
        have fun and don’t forget to wear your seatbelt.</p>
